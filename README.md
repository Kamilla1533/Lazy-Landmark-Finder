# **Lazy-Landmark-Finder**
____
### **`Project overview`**
This project tackles the challenging task of recognizing famous global landmarks from low-quality images. While modern image classification models excel on pristine data, real-world photographs often suffer from blur, noise, low resolution, or poor lighting. This project demonstrates an effective approach to classifying such challenging inputs.
Built primarily with Python and the PyTorch deep learning framework, the core of this solution leverages the power of a pre-trained ResNet model through the concept of Transfer Learning.

### **`Technologies used:`**
  - **Python:** The primary programming language.
  - **PyTorch:** The deep learning framework for model building, training, and evaluation.
  - **torchvision:** For pre-trained models (ResNet18), dataset handling, and powerful image transformations.
  - **PIL (Pillow):** For image loading and basic manipulation.
  - **Matplotlib:** For data visualization (e.g., training curves, sample predictions).
